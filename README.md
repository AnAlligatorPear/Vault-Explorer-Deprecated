# Vault Explorer for Metrics via OSS Grafana/Prometheus

![img](img/vault_grafana_dashboard.png)

### Description
This is a fork of [Nico Kabar's Vault Lab](https://github.com/nicolaka/vault-lab/) that has been stripped of the local deployment of a lab Vault Cluster, Vault Namespaces and other extraneous additions, to focus solely on providing metrics observability into an existing Vault deployment hosted anywhere. The purpose of this application is to provide Vault users with a quick and easy metrics tool to measure client counts, traces, and other log information in a digestible format.  



### Requirements:

- Vault Enterprise/Dedicated License 
- [Docker for Mac/Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) with Kubernetes turned on (only tested this on Docker for Mac)
- Terraform CLI
- Vault CLI
- `kubectl` CLI
- [httpie](https://httpie.io/) which is easier/cooler version of `curl`. You can use just curl but need to convert the commands :)


### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repo into your local environment that has Docker for Mac/Windows running. 

2. Ensure that `kubectl` is correctly configured

```
 $ kubectl get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   63d   v1.28.2

 $ kubectl cluster-info     
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```


3. Ensure that your Docker Desktop Kubernetes configs are located in `~/.kube/config` or update the kubernetes provider config in the `providers.tf` file to reflect the actual path for your kubernetes config if it's not `~/.kube/config`. 



4. Initialize Terraform and run Terraform Plan/Apply. You will be asked to provide your Vault's Address and Admin Token during the Apply process.


```
$ terraform init                

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/vault from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/helm from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/kubernetes from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/vault v3.24.0
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/helm v2.12.1
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/kubernetes v2.25.2

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.


$ terraform apply --auto-approve
...

Apply complete! Resources: 43 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

alice_entity_lookup_id = "5ebdf273-3465-a6a3-0f39-9b1965e8cfcd"
alice_pre_created_entity_id = "8cd5d3de-e251-33b7-eed7-943fd916c2fe"
bob_entity_lookup_id = "2129b0a3-32fa-da3f-06c6-804d00bda5ba"
bob_pre_created_entity_id = "2129b0a3-32fa-da3f-06c6-804d00bda5ba"
dave_entity_lookup_id = "fbd55dbe-bfdb-5b49-c8b9-14c6667b37a5"

```

6. It will take a few minutes for the deloyment to finish, once it does you can validate that it deployed successfully

```
$ kubeclt get pod -n vaultexplorer
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

$  kubectl get ns

```

7. Once you deploy, these are the exposed services that you can acccess via your web browser:

| Name | Description | IP/Port | Credentials
| - | - | - | - |
| Prometheus | Prometheus Server | `http://localhost:30090` | None |
| Grafana | Grafana Server | `http://localhost:30002` | `admin/vault` |





### Vault API Identity + Clients Reference
```
# Returns details on the total number of entities 
$ http $VAULT_ADDR/v1/sys/internal/counters/entities "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN"

 # Returns details on the total number of tokens
$ http $VAULT_ADDR/v1/sys/internal/counters/tokens "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN"

 
# Returns total client count breakdown by auth method by namespace and new clients by month
$ http $VAULT_ADDR/v1/sys/internal/counters/activity "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" 

# Returns a list of unique clients that had activity within the provided start/end time 
$ http $VAULT_ADDR/v1/sys/internal/counters/activity/export "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" 

  
# Returns client activity for the current month 
$ http $VAULT_ADDR/v1/sys/internal/counters/activity/monthly "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" 

```

### Prometheus + Grafana Dashboards

We deployed a full Prometheus + Grafana Stack and loaded up a sample Grafana dashboard to monitor Vault and VSO. You can access Grafana using `http://localhost:30002` and login with username `admin` and password `vault`. Then go to **Dashboards > HashiCorp Vault**
